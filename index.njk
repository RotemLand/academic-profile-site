<p> Hi! I'm a second year PhD student in the <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/">Information School at the University of Washington</a>, 
advised by <a href="http://katiedavisresearch.com/"> Dr. Katie Davis</a> at the <a href="https://digitalyouth.ischool.uw.edu/">Digital Youth Lab</a>.
I am also currently a /<a href="https://www.plato-philosophy.org/programs-at-the-university-of-washington">Gradute Fellow</a>
at the Philosophy Learning and Teaching Orginazation (PLATO) at UW. 

</p>

<p> My research looks at the impact of digital design as it relates to youth wellbeing in educational settings (formal and otherwise). I particularly focus on helping childen develop strategies, methods,tools and perspectives to support the development of a critical and ethical sensitivity when it comes to technological systems. 
    Of my current favorite methods is examining technology with children through philosophical praxis with children, aiming to both provide them the agency they require to formulate their unique perspectives in technological manner as well as use those insights to collaborativly design with children.
    
</p>

<p> Prior to attending UW, I was a student at <a href="https://www.runi.ac.il/en/">Reichman University</a> in the <a href="https://milab.runi.ac.il/">Milab</a>, where I worked on creating tangible objects of play for children and adults in a meaningful and impactful manner. 
    I also received a <a href="https://go.tau.ac.il/he/humanities/ma/history-philosophy?v=additional-info">Masters in philosophy, science and digital 
    culture</a> from Tel Aviv University, while working in various learning specialist and marketing roles Salesforce, Google, etc.

<h3> Current Projects </h3>

<h4> Co-Designing for Trust <h4>

<h5> 2022-2023 </h5>

<p> This NSF funded <a href="https://www.codesigningfortrust.org/">project</a> is a collaboration between academic and community researchers, librarians, educators, and other partners working to 
design community-oriented solutions to misinformation. The project seeks to create locally-contextualized digital literacy resources that 
holistically address the ways that misinformation exploits our minds, emotions, and social circumstances.

Mentor: Dr. Katie Davis

<h4> Designing for Child Wellbeing </h4>

<h5> 2022 </h5>

<p> This project aims to systematically catalog the design metrics and motivations of companies/design teams across industry
    (platforms, app and game designers, video producers, content creators) who create digital products used by young children, paying
    attention to design assumptions and blind spots. This is a baseline analysis in order to, in the future, evaluate these features
    based on the metrics found and rank them in accordance to their profitability/wellness impact.
    
    Mentors: Dr. Alexis Hiniker, Dr. Jane Radensky

<h4> NatureCollections: a Collaboration with the Woodland Park Zoo (Seattle) </h4>

<h5> 2022-2023 </h5>

<p> NatureCollections is an app developed by a team of researchers at the University of Washington that seeks to harness the power of emerging 
technologies to engage elementary school children in an exploration of the natural world.  Leveraging kids’ love for collecting things (stickers, 
baseball cards, shells, etc.), NatureCollections lets kids take pictures of nature, and curate their photos in categories such as plants, birds, and 
landscapes. In collaboration with the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, we ran multiple studies to see whether the app does indeed inrease childen's nature connection
and enhance their experiences.
 Mentors: Dr. Katie Davis

<h4> Civic Engagement Module </h4>

<h5> 2021 - </h5>

<p> Developed a <a href="https://connectedlib.github.io/modules/civic-engagement/">civic engagement module</a> that supports public youth librarians’ skills and capacity to engage their youth patrons in civic actions.
    The module forms part of the <a href="https://connectedlib.github.io">ConnectedLib Toolkit</a>, an open, online professional development toolkit designed to support librarians’ efforts
    to leverage new technologies and promote youth’s connected learning experiences. The civic engagement module was launched in
    February 2022, and is divided into four sections, which aim to (1) define civic engagement and its core attributes; (2) identify the
    library’s roles and assets for building powerful civic engagement services; (3) provide the tools to draw on connected learning
    principles to support civic engagement; and (4) outline tools, techniques and topics for sparking civic interest and civic engagement
    in libraries. The civic engagement module is intended to be used by librarians in both rural and urban settings. Working through the
    content and activities in the module, libraries will be able to  identify the assets and opportunities within their communities to create
    impactful civic engagement programming based on their teen patrons’ interests, identities, and aspirations.

<h4> Teen Meaningful Tech Use </h4>

<h5> 2021 - </h5>

<p> This project aims to design,develop and test an intervention app, with the goal of helping teens to establish a sense of agency and
    intention over their social media use. Our goal is to support teens in feeling they’re in the driver’s seat of their social media
    experiences and through that improve their wellbeing. The developed app functions as a “wrapper” that allows researchers to control
    how teens enter the individual apps on their phone (e.g., Instagram, TikTok), as well as send reflective apps tied to the usage throughout
    the day. The intervention aims to break the cycle that many teens experience, whereby social media use they experience as unsatisfying
    contributes to lowered levels of wellbeing.
